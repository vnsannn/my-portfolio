# 🧑‍💻 Developer VIEN — Portfolio
### 🔰 Phase 3 — Complete | Phase 4 — In Progress (Documents ✓ · WHO AM I? ✓ · Milestones ✓ · Projects ✓)
![Portfolio Background](assets/images/banner.png)

A personal developer portfolio for **Vien Fritzgerald V. Calderon**, built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend. Features a dark aesthetic, dual-mode welcome page (Visitor & Developer), and a fully data-driven dashboard powered by Firebase Firestore and GitHub-hosted project metadata.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This portfolio presents Vien's developer life, projects, and background in a clean, interactive format. Visitors browse in read-only mode. Content is managed directly by the developer through an in-dashboard edit mode.

All content (projects, certificates, CV/resume documents, timeline events) is driven by Firestore documents. No data is hardcoded in JavaScript. Projects are fetched automatically from their own GitHub repos via `INFO.json`. Physical files (PDFs, certificate images) are stored in the GitHub repo under `data/files/` and served via `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏠 Welcome Page
- Simple landing page — click "Visit Page" to enter the portfolio dashboard

### 📊 Dashboard
- **Home**: Hero section with profile photo, name, and social icon links; CV/Resume doc cards with PDF.js thumbnails — data loaded from Firestore `portfolio/docs`; VIEW opens the GitHub PDF viewer, SAVE triggers a direct download
- **WHO AM I?**: Live age counter (updates every minute from DOB Dec 15 2006), stackable education cards (array — multiple degrees supported), bio paragraph, stat cards (Projects, Certificates, Yrs Experience, Languages) — counts auto-derived from Firestore data; stat cards navigate to their section on click; consistent empty states for bio, education, and languages
- **Languages & Tools**: Animated horizontal skill bars with language logo icons and brand colors; level labels per bar; legend card with 6 proficiency levels — click legend to open the full levels modal
- **TIMESTAMPS**: Auto-generated from Firestore `portfolio/timestamp` — repo slugs (with date), education sync entries, and milestone entries (`type: 'milestone'`); all sources merged and grouped by year descending, then sorted by month descending within each year; date shown on click (accordion toggle); "Learn More" on project/cert/education entries cross-links to the matching card; milestones show a delete X button in edit mode
- **Projects**: Year-grouped card grid auto-fetched via `timestamp` → `INFO.json` per repo; year derived from the `date` field stored in the Firestore `timestamp` entry (not from INFO.json); universal card spec with banner preview, accordion expand showing contribution text + Live and Source buttons; add/delete in edit mode
- **Certificates**: Gallery layout (220px cards, PNG previews, title, details, date); clicking a card opens a full-screen image overlay — data from Firestore `portfolio/certs`
- **SEND ME YOUR DM**: Contact form (name, email, subject, message) with full validation, animated error states, EmailJS integration with success/spinner states

> **Note:** All JSON data files have been migrated to Firebase Firestore. The `data/` folder now only holds physical files (PDFs, images). Do not add JSON files back to `data/`.

---

## ☁️ Firestore Data Structure

All dashboard content is stored in the `portfolio` collection in Firestore. No data is hardcoded in JavaScript.

```
portfolio/
├── credentials     # EmailJS config, auth UIDs, GitHub PAT
├── about           # Bio text, education array, proficiency array
├── certs           # Certificate metadata array
├── docs            # CV/Resume metadata arrays (cv + resume)
├── lang            # Language metadata array (name, color, icon)
└── timestamp       # Timeline registry — repo slugs (with date), education sync entries, milestones
```

Each document stores its data under a `data` field. Example for `timestamp`:
```json
{
    "data": [
        { "repo": "devssst/my-portfolio", "date": "2026-05" },
        { "repo": "devssst/btech-slims", "date": "2025-06" },
        { "type": "education", "title": "BSIT - DPLmB", "date": "2024-08", "desc": "Dalubhasaang Politekniko ng Lungsod ng Baliwag" },
        { "id": "milestone-1746432000000", "type": "milestone", "title": "Started freelancing", "desc": "First paid project.", "date": "05-01-2026" }
    ]
}
```
> Repo entries require a `date` field (`YYYY-MM`) — this is entered by the admin through the project add modal and is the single source of truth for project year/month grouping. The `date` field in INFO.json is ignored.
> Milestone `date` is stored as `MM-DD-YYYY`; rendered in the timeline as `Month YYYY`.

Example for `about`:
```json
{
    "bio": { "text": "Your bio paragraph here." },
    "education": [
        {
            "course": "Bachelor of Science in Information Technology",
            "school": "Dalubhasaang Politekniko ng Lungsod ng Baliwag",
            "schoolStart": "08-12-2024",
            "schoolEnd": "05-30-2028",
            "year": "1st Year"
        }
    ],
    "proficiency": [
        { "language": "CSS", "level": 0 },
        { "language": "JavaScript", "level": 2 }
    ]
}
```
> **education** is an array — multiple degrees can be stacked. Dates stored as `MM-DD-YYYY`. If `schoolEnd` is in the future, the card shows `— present`; if past, shows `Graduated: YYYY`. Old single-map format is auto-migrated to array on first save.


Example for `docs`:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "cv": [],
        "resume": [
            {
                "id": "doc-1746432000000",
                "title": "Resume",
                "type": "Resume",
                "uploaded": "2026-05-06",
                "file": "data/files/Resume.pdf"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### INFO.json — place at root of each project repo
```json
{
    "id": "unique-id",
    "name": "Project Name",
    "description": "One sentence shown on the card.",
    "about": "Full paragraph shown on expand.",
    "contributions": "Your role and what you built.",
    "stack": ["PROGRAMMING", "LANGUAGE", "STACK"],
    "banner": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickname/your-project-repo/main/assets/images/banner.png",
    "live": "https://nickname.github.io/your-project-repo",
    "source": "https://github.com/nickname/your-project-repo"
}
```
> `year` and `date` fields are no longer read from INFO.json. Date is entered by the admin in the project add modal and stored in `portfolio/timestamp`. Remove both fields from existing INFO.json files to avoid confusion.
> **banner** must be a full `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL. Relative paths will 404. Omit the field to show the `fa-code` placeholder icon.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Internet connection (for Firestore, GitHub fetch + EmailJS)

### Running
Access the live site: https://devssst.github.io/my-portfolio

### Adding a new project — Edit Mode
1. Log in and activate edit mode from the badge dropdown
2. Navigate to the **PROJECTS** section — a **+ New Project** button appears in the heading
3. Enter the repo slug (`nickname/project-repo`) and select the project month/year
4. Click Add Project — the site fetches `INFO.json` to verify the repo is public, then saves `{ repo, date }` to `portfolio/timestamp`; the card renders immediately

### Deleting a project — Edit Mode
1. Activate edit mode and navigate to **PROJECTS**
2. Red X buttons appear on each project card
3. Click the X and confirm — the repo entry is removed from `portfolio/timestamp` and the card is removed from the grid immediately

### Uploading a document (CV / Resume) — Edit Mode
1. Log in and activate edit mode from the badge dropdown
2. Click the **+ New Document** button that appears in the HOME section
3. Drag and drop or browse for a PDF file
4. Fill in the title and select the document type (Resume or CV)
5. Click Upload — the file is pushed to `data/files/` via the GitHub Contents API and the metadata is saved to Firestore `portfolio/docs` automatically
6. The card renders immediately after upload, no page reload needed

### Deleting a document — Edit Mode
1. Activate edit mode — red X buttons appear on each document card
2. Click the X on the card you want to remove
3. Confirm in the delete dialog — the file is removed from GitHub and the metadata entry is removed from Firestore

### Adding a milestone — Edit Mode
1. Log in and activate edit mode from the badge dropdown
2. Navigate to the **TIMESTAMPS** section — an **+ Add Milestone** button appears in the heading
3. Click it and fill in the title, an optional description, and a date
4. Click Save Milestone — the entry (`type: 'milestone'`) is written to `portfolio/timestamp` and the timeline re-renders immediately

### Deleting a milestone — Edit Mode
1. Activate edit mode and navigate to **TIMESTAMPS**
2. Red X buttons appear on each milestone entry
3. Click the X and confirm — the entry is removed from `portfolio/timestamp` and the timeline updates in place

### Adding a certificate
Certificates upload/delete via edit mode is planned for Phase 4. For now, add the PNG to `data/files/` manually and add an entry to `portfolio/certs` in Firestore under `data.certificates`.

> **Existing repos**: if you added repos to `portfolio/timestamp` before the project add modal existed (bare `{ "repo": "..." }` entries with no `date` field), go into Firestore and manually add a `date: "YYYY-MM"` field to each entry — otherwise they will render without a date and sort to the current year.

## 🎨 Design Language

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Python code-art image (`background.png`), `background-attachment: fixed`
- **Overlay**: Single `body::before` — `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)` applied once globally
- **Header**: `rgba(17, 25, 40, 0.80)` with its own `backdrop-filter: blur(8px) saturate(180%)`
- **Cards**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.001–0.01)` — defined primarily by borders, not fill
- **Accent Purple**: `#a855f7` / `#7c22e8` / `#c026d3`
- **Logo**: Red `#FF2200` V on black
- **Text Primary**: `#ffffff`
- **Text Muted**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35–0.65)`

> Per-card `backdrop-filter` is disabled (commented out) for performance. Glassmorphism is achieved via the single global overlay. Commented blocks are left intentionally for future re-enablement.

### Language Bar Colors
- **HTML**: `#E34F26` — **CSS**: `#663399` — **JavaScript**: `#F7DF1E` — **Python**: `#013763` — **Java**: `#E32C2E`

### UI Highlights
- 6-section tab navigation: `home`, `about`, `timeline`, `projects`, `certificates`, `reach`
- Mouse wheel and touch swipe section hijacking (300ms cooldown, 5px threshold) — textarea and open modal scroll excluded
- Profile card smooth slide-out; state synced across all 4 content sections
- Purple scrollbar auto-appears on scroll, fades after 1.5s
- Animated skill bars triggered once on first ABOUT entry
- Clickable stat cards navigate to their section
- Consistent empty states: centered FA icon + muted text

## 📋 Update Logs

### Phase 4 — Projects Edit Mode + Date Architecture Overhaul (May 9 2026)
- **Projects add complete**: "+ New Project" button injected into PROJECTS heading in edit mode; modal with repo slug input and `type="month"` date picker; validates `INFO.json` exists and is accessible before saving; guards against duplicate repos; writes `{ repo, date }` to `portfolio/timestamp`; re-renders projects and timeline in place
- **Projects delete complete**: red X button on each project card (visible in edit mode only); confirm modal; removes repo entry from `portfolio/timestamp` by slug; filters `FETCHED_PROJECTS` in memory; re-renders both projects and timeline immediately
- **Date ownership moved to Firestore**: project dates are no longer read from `INFO.json` — `date` field is entered by the admin in the add modal and stored in the `portfolio/timestamp` entry as `YYYY-MM`; `loadAllData()` now attaches `e.date` from the Firestore entry onto each project object, overriding anything in INFO.json
- **`year` field removed from project sorting**: `renderProjects()` previously used `info.year` (from INFO.json) for year-group bucketing; now derives year from `info.date.split('-')[0]` — same source as timeline month sort; `year` and `date` fields should be removed from existing INFO.json files
- **INFO.json cache busting**: all `raw.githubusercontent.com` INFO.json fetches now append `?t=${Date.now()}` — prevents browser and GitHub CDN from serving stale cached responses after INFO.json edits
- **Milestones moved to `portfolio/timestamp`**: milestones are no longer stored in a separate `portfolio/milestones` Firestore document — they are entries with `type: 'milestone'` inside `portfolio/timestamp`; `loadAllData()` derives `FETCHED_MILESTONES` by filtering for `type === 'milestone'` directly from the timestamp array; the `portfolio/milestones` collection can be deleted

### Phase 4 — Milestones Edit Mode + Bug Fixes + Timeline Sort (May 8 2026)
- **Milestone add complete**: "Add Milestone" button injected into the TIMESTAMPS section heading in edit mode; modal with title, description, and date fields; date stored as `MM-DD-YYYY`; entry written to `portfolio/timestamp` with `type: 'milestone'`; timeline re-renders in place without reload
- **Milestone delete complete**: red X button on each milestone entry (visible in edit mode only); confirm modal matching universal delete spec; entry removed from `portfolio/timestamp` by id; timeline re-renders in place
- **Timeline sort by month**: entries within each year group are now sorted by month descending (newest first) — previously entries were pushed in source order (timeline → projects → certs → milestones) with no secondary sort; all four sources now carry a `month` field (1–12) used for sorting
- **Bug — `education` default**: `loadAllData()` was defaulting `education` to `{}` (object) instead of `[]` (array) when the Firestore field was absent — broke `Array.isArray()` guards downstream; fixed to `|| []`
- **Bug — `handleDocDelete` hard-gate removed**: an early `return` when `GH_TOKEN` was null was blocking Firestore deletion entirely; the inner `try/catch` around `ghDeleteFile` already handles GitHub failure gracefully — Firestore deletion now always proceeds regardless of GitHub cred state
- **Bug — `certsRoot` class**: `#certsRoot` incorrectly had `class="certs-grid"` — the outer container was a flex wrapper causing company groups to sit side-by-side; class removed, groups now stack vertically as intended
- **Bug — `text-align: justify` scoping**: the property was incorrectly applied to `input` elements via the shared `input, textarea` selector; moved to `.about-edit-field textarea` only, along with `resize: vertical`
- **Non-bug — `parseStoredDate` hoisted**: function was declared inside `eduArr.forEach()` on every iteration; moved above the loop
- **Firestore structure**: milestones are stored in `portfolio/timestamp` with `type: 'milestone'` — there is no separate `portfolio/milestones` collection

### Phase 4 — WHO AM I? Edit Mode + Bug Fixes (May 7 2026)
- **About edit modal complete**: Bio textarea, stackable Education entries (add/remove dynamically), Proficiency language picker — all write to Firestore `portfolio/about`
- **Education refactored to array**: `education` field in Firestore changed from a single map to an array — multiple degrees can be stacked (BSIT + Masters, etc.); old single-map format auto-migrated on first save
- **Education delete**: per-card delete button (edit mode only) removes the specific entry by index from the array; remaining entries and timeline stay intact
- **Education dates**: stored as `MM-DD-YYYY`; displayed as `Month DD, YYYY — present` (ongoing) or `Graduated: YYYY` (completed)
- **Timeline sync**: all education entries sync to `portfolio/timestamp` on save/delete — strip-and-rewrite strategy ensures no stale entries
- **Empty states**: Bio shows `fa-file-lines` + "No Bio"; Education shows `fa-graduation-cap` + "No listed education"; Languages shows `fa-code` + "No listed language" with legend hidden
- **Modal UX**: overlay click-to-close blocked while any input/textarea/select is focused; section dividers (border-top) added between BIO / EDUCATION / PROFICIENCY sections
- **Bio modal leak fixed**: `openAboutEditModal` no longer reads bio from DOM — reads from `FETCHED_ABOUT` only, preventing "No Bio" placeholder from leaking into the textarea
- **Cert/doc URL encoding**: `data.file` path segments now run through `encodeURIComponent` before building `raw.githubusercontent.com` and blob viewer URLs — fixes 404 on filenames with `[`, `]`, spaces, or other reserved characters
- **Lang delete X removed** from skill bars — delete is handled in the About edit modal only; `edit-active` toggle on `#skillsBars` also removed
- **Label accessibility fix**: `<label>LANGUAGE</label>` in the About modal now has `for="aboutLangSearch"` — resolves browser console accessibility warning
- **Text alignment**: Bio textarea and Reach Me message textarea now `text-align: justify`
- **CSS cleanup**: removed dead `.certs-sort-bar`, `.certs-sort-btn`, `.certs-empty` blocks; removed no-op `text-shadow: 0 1px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0)` from `.about-bio`; merged split `.about-edu-card` declaration; removed empty commented `.level-item-body {}` block

### Phase 4 — Documents Edit Mode + PDF Fixes (May 6 2026)
- Documents upload complete: drag-and-drop modal, title + type fields, GitHub Contents API push, Firestore metadata write, in-place re-render after upload
- Documents delete complete: red X per card (edit mode only), confirm modal, GitHub file deletion + Firestore metadata removal
- PDF.js thumbnail now fetches from `raw.githubusercontent.com` — fixes 404 on newly uploaded files before GitHub Pages redeploys
- VIEW button opens the GitHub blob viewer (`github.com/.../blob/main/...`) — renders PDF inline in browser without downloading
- SAVE button fetches the raw URL and triggers a named download via blob — works cross-origin without relying on the `download` attribute
- `cursor: pointer` added to `.doc-card-btn` — was implicit on `<a>` tags, now explicit for button elements

### Phase 3 — Firebase & Firestore Integration (May 5 2026)
- Firebase Authentication integrated — Email/Password + Google Sign-In, dual UID verification
- All JSON data migrated to Firestore `portfolio` collection — `timestamp`, `certs`, `docs`, `credentials` documents
- `data/` folder reduced to `files/` only (PDFs and certificate images)
- `loadAllData()` fully rewritten to use Firestore SDK
- EmailJS credentials now loaded from Firestore at runtime

### Phase 3 — Data Architecture Refinements (May 4 2026)
- `data/projects.json` renamed to `data/timestamp.json` — now accepts both repo slugs and direct timeline entries in the same array
- `TIMELINE_DATA` constant removed from `dashboard.js` entirely — all timeline data now lives in Firestore
- `FETCHED_TIMELINE[]` added as a third data store alongside `FETCHED_PROJECTS[]` and `FETCHED_CERTS[]`
- `renderDocs()` now properly `await`-ed in `boot()` — previously called without await
- EmailJS credentials moved from hardcoded JS constants to Firestore — fetched at runtime, guarded before send
- `certs-sort-btn` filter pills removed from certificates section — company group labels serve as visual separators
- Textarea scroll guard added to wheel hijack handler

### Phase 3 — Full Dashboard (May 3 2026)
- All 6 sections built and functional
- JSON-driven content: projects via `INFO.json` fetch chain, certs via `certs.json`, docs via `docs.json`
- `boot()` async with individual `try/catch` per render — crash isolation
- Profile card collapse synced across ABOUT, TIMESTAMPS, PROJECTS, CERTIFICATES
- EmailJS integrated and confirmed working
- Universal card spec applied to CV/Resume, Projects, Certificates
- Skills bar animation, levels modal, stat card navigation
- Per-element scrollbar Map — fixes shared scroll state bug

### Phase 2 — Dashboard Shell (April 28 2026)
- Dashboard HTML skeleton with 6 section anchors
- Sticky header with ADMIN/VISITOR badge and dropdown
- `switchSection()`, session-based access control

### Phase 1 — Welcome Page (April 19 2026)
- Welcome page with glassmorphism card design
- Form validation with shake/error/success animations
